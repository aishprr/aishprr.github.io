Hello!

This is many many years too late, but I've finally decided to prop this website up as a way to share my thoughts and experiences about the few different interests in my life! It's also going to be a one-stop shop for anyone that's interested in knowing a bit more about me, because what else am I gonna do when I have access to aishwaryapremrenu.com :P

I am present on the sidelines on a few different social media platforms, but for the most part, I do not have the apps installed on my phone (steps had to be taken to protect a little bit of my sanity and privacy) and I definitely do not want to be completely reliant on any of them - hence the reason for doing this here.

Lately I've been spending a lot of my free time outdoors, hiking or biking or simply gallivanting around the SF Bay Area, so first of all, I would love to use this platform to share some of my favourite spots. I've also found myself a little removed from one my first loves, music - so I plan to use this as a way to share some of my recordings and work to serve as motivation for myself! There are several other topics I learn more about every day, like finances, fitness, the tech industry and cooking that I am hoping to get more clarity on for myself by writing out in a methodical and logical way - as I've always found that's how I learn and register best!

If you know me well, you also know that I love lists and you know how much it took for me to not have the above paragraph in list form, so take that as one of my first steps in improving my writing form!

There is a possibility that these thoughts will never be seen by anyone but me, and I am okay with that.
If not, thanks for stopping by! <3
